### A Basic Nagios Primer 
(as told to Joe DeVivo by Sean Carey)
1. A Nagios check is a shell script

3. The most important part to a nagios script is the return codes.
  >  0 OK  
  >  1 Warning  
  >  2 Critical  
  >  3 Unknown
4. Can be written in any language as long as the exit codes are right.
  * Perl is the standard
  * Python / Bash is usually installed by default, and easier to work with
  * Ruby is not usually installed by default
